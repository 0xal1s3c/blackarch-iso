Welcome to BlackArch Linux!

Some important notes:
  - The dhcpcd is not configured by default because of security reasons. Either
    use 'systemctl start dhcpcd' to start manually or 'systemctl enable dhcpcd'
    to enable at boot.
  - Type 'blackarch-install' to install BlackArch Linux from ISO.
  - A ChangeLog file about this ISO can be found in /root.
