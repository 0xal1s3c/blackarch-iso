Welcome to BlackArch Linux!

Some important notes:

1. The dhcpcd isn't configured by default because of security reasons. Either
use 'systemctl start dhcpcd' to start manually or 'systemctl enable dhcpcd' to
enable at boot.
2. Type 'blackarch-install' to install BlackArch Linux from ISO.
3. A ChangeLog file about this ISO can be found in /root.
