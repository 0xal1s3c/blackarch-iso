This automatically generated configuration consists of the following files:
- /usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xaccess
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xwilling
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xsetup
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xstartup
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xreset
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xsession
- /usr/share/config/kdm/backgroundrc

This config was derived from existing files. As the used algorithms are
pretty dumb, it may be broken.
Information from these files was extracted:
- /usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc
These files were directly incorporated:
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xaccess
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xwilling
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xsetup
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xstartup
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xreset
- /usr/share/config/kdm/Xsession
- /usr/share/config/kdm/backgroundrc
Old files that would have been overwritten were renamed to <oldname>.bak.

Try 'genkdmconf --help' if you want to generate another configuration.
